      Keep track of all the required steps you need to make in order to deliver and complete one task.<br><br>
      Increase your productivity regardless the context switching and distractions you get on a daily basis.<br><br> 
      Just take a moment before diving into development to analyze the task requirements and write down the steps.<br><br>
      Come back occasionally to mark steps as completed and inspect your progress.
